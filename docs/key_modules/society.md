# Society
## 1. Concept
The society module is one of the core modules of CAMEL. By simulating the information exchange process, this module studies the social behaviors among agents. 

Currently, the society module aims to enable agents to collaborate autonomously toward completing tasks while keeping consistent with human intentions and requiring minimal human intervention. It includes two frameworks: Babyagi-Playing and Role-Playing, which are used to plan the interaction behaviors of agents to achieve research objectives.

Taking Role-Playing as an example, this framework was designed in an instruction-following manner. These roles independently undertake the responsibilities of executing and planning tasks, respectively. The dialogue is continuously advanced through a turn-taking mechanism, thereby collaborating to complete tasks. The main concepts include:

Task: a task can be as simple as an idea, initialized by an inception prompt.

AI User: the agent who is expected to provide instructions.

AI Assistant: the agent who is expected to respond with solutions that fulfill the instructions.

### 2. Types

## 2.1 Babyagi-Playing
Babyagi is framework from "Task-driven Autonomous Agent"

## 2.2 Role-Playing

Role-Playing is a unique cooperative agent framework of CAMEL. Through this framework, agents in CAMEL overcome numerous challenges, such as *role flipping*, *assistant repeats instructions*, *flake replies*, *infinite loop of messages*, and *conversation termination conditions.*

When using Role-Playing framework in Camel, predefined prompts are used to create unique initial settings for different agents. For example, if the user wants to initialize a assistant agent, the agent will be initialized with the following prompt.

- Never forget you are a <ASSISTANT_ROLE> and I am a <USER_ROLE>. This assigns the chosen role to the assistant agent and provides it with information about the userâ€™s role.
- Never flip roles! Never instruct me! This prevents agents from flipping roles. In some cases, we have observed the assistant and the user switching roles, where the assistant suddenly takes control and instructs the user, and the user follows those instructions.
- You must decline my instruction honestly if you cannot perform the instruction due to physical, moral, legal reasons or your capability and explain the reasons. This prohibits the agent from producing harmful, false, illegal, and misleading information.
- Unless I say the task is completed, you should always start with: Solution: <YOUR_SOLUTION>. <YOUR_SOLUTION> should be specific, and provide preferable implementations and examples for task-solving. This encourages the assistant to always responds in a consistent format, avoiding any deviation from the structure of the conversation, and preventing vague or incomplete responses, which we refer to as flake responses, such as "I will do something".
- Always end your solution with: Next request. This ensures that the assistant keeps the conversation going by requesting a new instruction to solve.

### Init_chat Function
Initializes the chat by resetting both of the assistant and user agents. Returns an initial message for the role-playing session.  
```python
def init_chat(self, init_msg_content: Optional[str] = None) -> BaseMessage:
        self.assistant_agent.reset()
        self.user_agent.reset()
        default_init_msg_content = (
            "Now start to give me instructions one by one. "
            "Only reply with Instruction and Input."
        )
        if init_msg_content is None:
            init_msg_content = default_init_msg_content
        # Initialize a message sent by the assistant
        init_msg = BaseMessage.make_assistant_message(
            role_name=self.assistant_sys_msg.role_name,
            content=init_msg_content,
        )

        return init_msg
```

### Step Function
Advances the conversation by taking a message from the assistant, processing it using the user agent, and then processing the resulting message using the assistant agent. 

Returns a tuple containing the resulting assistant message, whether the assistant agent terminated the conversation, and any additional assistant information, as well as
a tuple containing the resulting user message, whether the user agent terminated the conversation, and any additional user information.
```python
def step(
        self,
        assistant_msg: BaseMessage,
    ) -> Tuple[ChatAgentResponse, ChatAgentResponse]:
        user_response = self.user_agent.step(assistant_msg)
        if user_response.terminated or user_response.msgs is None:
            return (
                ChatAgentResponse([], False, {}),
                ChatAgentResponse(
                    [], user_response.terminated, user_response.info
                ),
            )
        user_msg = self._reduce_message_options(user_response.msgs)
        self.user_agent.record_message(user_msg)

        assistant_response = self.assistant_agent.step(user_msg)
        if assistant_response.terminated or assistant_response.msgs is None:
            return (
                ChatAgentResponse(
                    [], assistant_response.terminated, assistant_response.info
                ),
                ChatAgentResponse([user_msg], False, user_response.info),
            )
        assistant_msg = self._reduce_message_options(assistant_response.msgs)
        self.assistant_agent.record_message(assistant_msg)

        return (
            ChatAgentResponse(
                [assistant_msg],
                assistant_response.terminated,
                assistant_response.info,
            ),
            ChatAgentResponse(
                [user_msg], user_response.terminated, user_response.info
            ),
        )
```

### Summary

In the future, we hope to expand this module to realize complex social behaviors among multi-agents, such as interaction, trust building, competition and cooperation, and conflict resolution.
